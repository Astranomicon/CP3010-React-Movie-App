# CP3010-React-Movie-App

This is a project/assignment for my ServerSide Programming course.

[Repository Link](https://github.com/WillPaul20/CP3010-React-Movie-App)

For this project I was required to build a website which hosted reviews for the user using JavaScript, React, Bootstrap for the styling, and MongoDB to store the backend data.
- The user can remove movies with the click of a button
- The user can add movies by filling out the form on the "Add Review" page.
